                    <p class="g1"> JJ an absolute sweetheart, full on girl next door vibes. JJ grew up in a 
                        small town and joined the FBI after hearing a lecture made by Rossi. In season one the 
                        show flirted the idea of JJ and Reid getting together (they don't TT.) But ulimately she
                        settles down with Will a detective. Although I feel the show did us wrong with this, JJ 
                        and Will got together super early in season 2 of a 15 season show. I understand why
                        JJ and Reid didn't get together but it would've been better if they maybe
                        looked into it more. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In season six JJ is offered a position in the Department of Defense which
                        she must take. She is taken to Saudi Arabia to be a liaison in the hunt for Osama bin
                        Laden. This bites her back when she is later kidnapped in season 9 by her former
                        collegue, Tivon Askari and tortured for the security codes. The writers showing a more
                        tough and bad as side of JJ.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In between season five and eight JJ reveals that her older sister Roslyn, committed suicide. 
                        JJ finding her sister only when she was 11 and admitting she 
                        froze. However in season 15 the team travel back to her hometown for a similar case to her sisters suicide.
                        JJ having held onto this trauma for years  finally gets some closure after finding the person responsible for 
                        the death of her sister.

                        <br>
                        More on JJ and Will and why I believe they don't fit well together. Throughout the show
                        they attempt to show more intimate moments between JJ and Will. Will being held hostage
                        and JJ consulting with Will about her trauma. Which just doesn't compare to the moments between
                        Reid and JJ. JJ being the only one who calls Reid "Spence" and them consulting with each other
                        in everything before anyone. It just seems off. But I'm glad JJ has a somewhat of a happy ending with Will.
