                    <p class="g1"> Reid is my favourite BAU team member. A genius who struggles in social
                        situations but an absolute sweetheart. He is and incredible asset to the 
                        team due to his eidetic memory and the fact he can read 20,000 words per
                        minute. His childhood is riddled with childhood bullying and having to be 
                        raised by his single mother dealing with paranoid schizophrenia. Heartbreakingly
                        at the age of 18 Reid had to send his mother to a mental institution. Throughout
                        the show Reid is worried that his mother's illness can be passed down genetically. 
                        Reid is often seen struggling with mental health and drug addiction after being held 
                        hostage by serial killer Tobias Hankel (S02E36.) Furthermore everyone who Reid's ever loved
                        has left him constantly. His mother who he looses as her schizophrenia gets worse and worse
                        and ends up forgetting him. JJ who falls in love with Will and Maeve his love dying. Gideon 
                        his mentor leaves him with a note, Morgan who has taken Reid under his wing leaves. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Although Reid's been through so much he stays true to himself. He's still the 
                        adorable genius whi has trouble with social behaviour but tries his best. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Honestly Reid deserved better. He was in love with JJ and then he found Maeve who
                        got murdered in front of him. He's been through so much and he deserved a happier 
                        ending TT. I would sell my kidney for Reid's happiness because he deserves it.
