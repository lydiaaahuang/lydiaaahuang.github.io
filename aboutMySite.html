                 My site on the hit tv show Criminal Minds has taught me a lot about Web Development and Design. 
                 Though the project I have learnt how to not only code a website with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) but to be able to design and alter the page using
                 CSS (Cascading Style Sheet.) With CSS I am able to alter colours, texts, size of objects and alter images. Furthermore
                 creating the alternative CSS page has allowed me to transfer my website between various platforms. To improve my website I used
                 elements of JS (Javascript) to add animation and interactive elements to my page. (The navigation bar and continuous sliding page.) 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 One of the things I struggled with the most with was proper indentation. At first I struggled to find incorrect indentation, this was an issue
                 as it would affect my CSS and the overall look of my page. However I was able to pick up on proper indentation as I worked on my website more and practiced 
                 HTML more. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Next time I would like to try a more minimalist website style. A minimalist style could be created with a lighter colour palette and more icons and solid imagery. 
                 <br>
                 However I feel if this was to be done another topic would have to be chosen as doing a website on a tv show you have to show cast images and screen caps of the show. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Dedicating a website to a tv show that has a special place in my heart has allowed me to express my passion in a creative and 
                 interactive form. Throughout this project I have been able to learn valuable skills while doing something I enjoy and find entertaining.
