       <div class="description">
         <p>Criminal Minds is an American thriller, mystery and crime drama. It revolves around the 
           <br>
           methodology and psychosis of criminals. The show is produced by Jeff Davis and 
           <br>
           first aired in 2005 and lasted till 2020. It ran for a total of 15 seasons consisting of 324 episodes.
           <br>
           Primarily the show follows a team of specialists from the FBI known as 
           <br>
           the BAU (behaviourial analysis unit.) 
           <br>
           <br>
           Throughout the 15 seasons the main members of the group Aaron Hotchner/Hotch (Thomas Gibson), 
           <br>
           Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), Jennifer Jareau (A. J. Cook), 
           <br>
           Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) and David Rossi (Joe Mantegna) 
           <br>
           work as a team to solve crimes. However the cast changes up a lot and brings back old characters frequently. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Criminal Minds became one of the top watched shows on the CBS in America leading to a number of 
           <br>
           spin offs including Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders, Criminal Minds: Suspect Behaviour 
           <br>
           and even a Korean version of Criminal Minds. Surprisingly the spin offs did not do as well 
           <br>
           and had low view counts. Beyond Borders only made it up to season 2 whilst 
           <br>
           Suspect Behaviour never made it to the season 1 finale.

           Hi, my name is Lydia and I am a Student at ANU. From a young  
           <br>
           age I have been obsessed with fiction. Fictional books, tv shows, 
           <br>
           characters. Although as I have grown I have developed an interest  
           <br>
           in crime dramas and have proudly watched most of the infamous crime  
           <br>
           shows such as NCIS (which i didn't enjoy) Law and Order (original and  
           <br>
           SVU), bones etc. So I believe I have a fair amount of knowledge on 
           <br>
           crime shows and plots. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Although watching so many crime shows you can see a few similar 
           <br>
           plot lines and the roles of the team are alike (nerd, hunk, beauty, 
           <br>
           comical relief.) The first time I watched an episode of a crime show 
           <br>
           was at the ripe age of 8 when I walked in on my Aunty watching an episode 
           <br>
           of Criminal Minds. However back then I was easily frightened and never 
           <br>
           made it through the whole episode but now I am a part of the criminal minds  
           <br>
           fandom. Even though Criminal Minds changes characters often they still create 
           <br>
           an emotional connection to the main team. Through the 15 seasons I have 
           <br>
           become attached to the BAU team and loved watching the growth and  
           <br>
           development of characters.
           <br>
           <br>
           Personally I am a Reid and JJ shipper and (spoiler alert) season 15 ending with 
           <br>
           JJ confessing she has been in love with Reid all these years really made me 
           <br>
           extremely frustrated at the show (why did they bring up the abandoned love 
           <br>
           plot between JJ and Reid  ON THE FINAL EPISODE.) 
           <br>
           <br>
           Because of my love for Criminal Minds I have decided to make a website 
           <br> 
           all about the show.

          Criminal Minds is a fandom page on the hit tv show Criminal Minds. Unlike most available Criminal Mind 
          <br>
          fandom pages this websites focuses more on my personal opinions of the shows and things that were 
          <br>
          hit and a miss. Plot lines that were messy or characters that should or shouldn't have been killed off. 
          <br>
          This blog talks about topics that you would talk about with your friends when discussing the show.

          Basically my opinion on various aspects of Criminal Minds.
